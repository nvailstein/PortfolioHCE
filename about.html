			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>Software Engineer graduating in May 2020 from Monmouth University.
				<br>
				<br>
				Knowing how systems work and developing ways to build and modify them has been my passion since my first Lego set. I have spent countless hours increasing my understanding on how systems work and what I can do to change them. I believe that knowledge is the driving factor to success and I am looking for an opportunity to both expand and use mine.
				<br>
				<br>
				Working with computers is both a passion and hobby for me. I like to see through the whole development cycle of a project, from gathering requirements to deployment. I am very strong in a small team environment and am open to new work environments. I have developed numerous projects both small and large at my time at university.
				<br>
				<br>
				Outside of software development I have many hobbies which have taught me a lot about myself and the world around me. I have been a pole vaulter for eight years and am currently on the track and field team at Monmouth University. I have been a musician for around twelve years playing both guitar and bass. I also have a passion for cars, machine operating, magic the gathering, and video games.
				<br>
				<br>
				I have work experience outside of my field which consisted of a summer job with Sylvan Motels Inc. under the leadership of John Hurler Sr and Andrew Hurler. At this job I worked as both a receptionist for two years and as the night auditor concurrently during the second year. I am no stranger to hard work and during my time there I averaged over fifty hours per week during most months working there.
				<br>
				<br>
				Skills/Interests: Java, C/C++, Python, C#, HTML, CSS. Swift, SQL, Ruby on Rails, and Git
